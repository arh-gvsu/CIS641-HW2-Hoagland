Interests:
- Learning! Currently studying software engineering.
- The outdoors. Pretty much all of it.
- Solving business problems with technology. Enterprise systems and everything in their periphery.

## Technical Background

In the course of studying software engineering, I picked up a bit of Java, but my primary background is in business systems, including:
- ERP administration, programming, and integrations with a specialty in MS Dynamics Business Central
- Database administration, primarily focused on SQL Server and Azure SQL Server
- IT Project Management
- (While not entirely technical) IT Leadership with almost 10 years of experience leading teams in Infrastructure, Analytics, and Enterprise Systems

## CIS 641 Term Project

For my semester term project, I set out with three distinct intentions: to learn something new; to build something I could use; and to meet the project requirements sufficiently enough to acheive a good grade. 

To accomplish these objectives, I decided to build a Project Time Tracker, useful to both Project Managers and Project Resources (the hands-on doers of a project). Accurate time-keeping is, in itself, massively time-consuming. Users must allocate their time to buckets, often trying to recall, at the end of a week, what they spent time on, how much time they spent, and how much of their time was actually billable. Project costs are then analyzed as a comparison of quoted/estimated time and actual time, and clients are billed out based on time spent accomplishing their specific project tasks. This all amounts to an administrative hassle for most PMs and Project Resources and is something that I've personally come to despise on every project I've worked on professionally. To resolve this, I will build a Project Time Tracker that gives two options for time input (manual entry or start/stop timer function) as well as a way to track that time to specific tasks in a given project for comparing actual time to estimated time. The system will be easy to use and navigate, both for the Project Manager and for the Project Resource users, and will reduce the amount of administrative time required for compiling and analyzing project time-keeping.
