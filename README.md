Interests:
- Learning! Currently studying software engineering.
- The outdoors. Pretty much all of it.
- Solving business problems with technology. Enterprise systems and everything in their periphery.

## Technical Background

In the course of studying software engineering, I picked up a bit of Java, but my primary background is in business systems, including:
- ERP administration, programming, and integrations with a specialty in MS Dynamics Business Central
- Database administration, primarily focused on SQL Server and Azure SQL Server
- IT Project Management
- (While not entirely technical) IT Leadership with almost 10 years of experience leading teams in Infrastructure, Analytics, and Enterprise Systems
